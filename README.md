# Project TItle: Credit Card Approval: Improving Model with Diverse Machine Learning Techniques

#Following are the 2 Project files which covers all the models used in the project.
#1 ML_ProjectModels1.ipynb
#2 ML_ProjectModels2.ipynb

#ML_ProjectModels1 file covers Perceptron, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier and it's SMOTE version
#ML_ProjectModels2 file covers XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression  and it's SMOTE version

#Hyper parameter tuning with grid search and random search is included in both files.

#Note : make sure the crx.data file is uploaded before running the file.
